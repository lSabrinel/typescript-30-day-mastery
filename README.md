# TypeScript-30-day-mastery

30-day intensive TypeScript learning and practice program focused on type safety, real-world patterns, and interview-level problem solving. Includes course exercises, guided projects, and progressively more advanced TypeScript challenges.

# Goal
The goal of this repository is to build strong and practical TypeScript skills through a 30-day learning plan.

The focus is on:

- Understanding the TypeScript type system
- Writing type-safe, maintainable code
- Applying TypeScript to small real-world projects
- Preparing for advanced TypeScript interviews

# Learning strategy

I follow a structured approach:

1. Learn a concept (course/reading)
2. Apply it in isolation (small exercices)
3. Reinforce it with a project or challenge
